        <br>
        
        <p>PSIT is growing rapidly and will soon become a top-notch institute in India. Being a student here, my sister says that it is one of the top institutes in Kanpur or even UP as a whole.

            The institute offers a B.Tech degree in CSE, ECE, IT, ME, and EEE and is one of the best colleges when compared to AKTU approved colleges in UP.
            Faculties are highly qualified and few of them are even experienced in industries.
            Rules at PSIT are very strict. If you fail to maintain 90% attendance, you will have to submit a fine.
            The institute majorly focuses on theoretical aspects compared to practical knowledge.
            The best thing is their Training department, where you will be taught public speaking, leadership skills, qualitative aptitude, logical reasoning, and English proficiency along with value-added courses based on your field of interest.
            You will be trained in all these aspects from your second year to make you skilled enough to face real-world problems by the time you graduate.
            Apart from these, the facilities offered are top-notch. Classrooms are air-conditioned with Projectors and high-speed internet.
            Infrastructure is the best thing out there. Food at the canteen is manageable as well.
            Overall, PSIT Kanpur is a great place to pursue your B.Tech from.</p>
